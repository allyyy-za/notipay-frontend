- React.js
- Material UI
- Cascading Style Sheets


## ðŸ–¥ Implementation of Technologies Used

### React.js
- React.js was used for the front-end of the web application.
- How is it used on the web application?
    - **Initial Setup to Visual Studio Code**
        ```bash
            npx create-react-app notipay-frontend
            cd my-app
            npm start 
        ```
- **Creation of components**
    - Most of the components are made with react functional component skeletons, except for the edit modal which was made with react class component skeleton.
    
    **React Functional Component Skeleton**
    ```JavaScript
    export default function NameOfFunction() {
        return(
            <div> Name of Function </div>
        );
    }
    ```
    **React Class Component Skeleton**
    ```JavaScript
    export default class NameOfClass extends Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div> Name of Class </div>
            )
        }
    }
    ```
- Create the **reusable components** that is going to be reused all through out the development. These are just small components such as:
    - Text field
    - Button
    - Popup
    
- Create the **necessary components and pages** for the web application such as:
    - Landing page
    - Home page
    - Login modal
    - Registration modal
    - Edit modal
    - Account settings modal
    
- **Creation of routes to API**
    - Since Spring Boot REST API was used for this project, creation of routes from front-end to back-end was done using the fetch API.
        ```JavaScript
        fetch('/api/**')
    	    .then(response => response.json())
    	    .then(data => console.log(data))
    	    .catch(err => console.error(err));
        ```

### React.js
- Material UI was used for the components of the front-end of the web application.
- How is it used on the web application?
    - Initial Setup
        - To install the components of Material UI into the web application:
            ```bash
            npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
            ```
        - To install the icons of Material UI into the web application:
            ```bash
            npm install @mui/icons-material
            ```
    - Integrating Material UI to components in React.js
        - Material UI components to be used in the web application are as follow:
            - Text Field
            - Button
            - Typography
            - Dialog
            - Grid
            - Stack
